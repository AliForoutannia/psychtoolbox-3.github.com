title: End of life for 32-Bit PTB for OS X, and OS X 10.4, 10.5

A little reminder that I will suspend development & support for:

-   All 32-Bit versions of PTB for Mac OS X, aka 32-Bit Matlab.
-   All versions of PTB for OS X 10.4 "Tiger" and 10.5 "Leopard".
-   All classic Apple Quicktime support.
-   The PsychtoolboxKernelDriver for 32-Bit OS X Kernels.

… before end of May 2013. The latest beta release from yesterday may be the last
one for those platforms. Maybe I’ll do some “service pack” releases to fix
post-release bugs common to all platforms or such within the next few days or
weeks, but no significant new features or improvements or bug fixes will be
added anymore until the quickly approaching end of life. At end of life time, a
new unsupported branch will be created for those who want to stick to the old
version.
