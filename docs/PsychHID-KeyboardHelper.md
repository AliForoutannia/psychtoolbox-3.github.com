##### [Psychtoolbox](Psychtoolbox)>[PsychHID](PsychHID).{mex*} subfunction

rc = PsychHID('KeyboardHelper', commandCode)

Low-Level helper function for controlling keyboard input.  
This function accepts a couple esoteric commandCode's to control low-level  
aspects of how keyboards are handled. The commands are intentionally  
undocumented, because only PTB developers should deal with this interface.
