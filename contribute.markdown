We welcome user contributions and improvements to this website.

Adding material to the wiki portion only requires a GitHub login. You are
encouraged to add FAQ entries there concerning common issues, programming
pitfalls, or reports about hardware.

When you get (or just see) a particularly helpful answer on the forum,
we'll all be grateful if you would add it to the [Psychtoolbox FAQ](###FAQ)
to everyone's benefit. You may want to edit it a bit, deleting the
irrelevant and perhaps making the relevant context more explicit. 


### How to help develop the toolbox

With Psychtoolbox-3 we have moved to an open source development model, and we
welcome contributions from users like yourself. If you improve a particular M
file in the Psychtoolbox, we'll want to incorporate your improved version into
the toolbox. Just send us a patch or a pull request in Github against the
[psychtoolbox-3/psychtoolbox-3](https://github.com/Psychtoolbox-3/Psychtoolbox-3)
repo.
