Despite its popularity, Psychtoolbox-3 currently doesn't receive any funding for its ongoing development and maintenance. Moreover, since June 2013, Mario Kleiner, the main developer and maintainer of Psychtoolbox-3, works full time on Psychtoolbox without any financial or other compensation, essentially treating Psychtoolbox ongoing development and future-proofing as a very time consuming and expensive "hobby".

If you want to show some gratitude for the work done and help to keep Psychtoolbox-3 development sustainable, please consider donating some money.

Currently one way of donating to Mario Kleiner is by donating to the user "kleinerm" via the GratiPay service. This is useful if you want to donate a small amount in a weekly recurring fashion:

- [GratiPay - Donate to Mario Kleiner](https://gratipay.com/kleinerm/)

Another way to donate is via PayPal:
