History and Credits
-------------------

Version 1 (released 1995, Macintosh only) was written by David Brainard,
with some help from others and support from an NSF ILI grant awarded to
David Brainard. Version 2 (released 1996 for Macintosh and 2000 for
Windows) was written by David Brainard and Denis Pelli, incorporating
Denis Pelli's `VideoToolbox`, with help from others. In particular,
Mei Zhang, Elliot Waldron and Allen Ingling contributed heavily to the
first working version for Windows. Version 2.5 for Windows and initial
development of the OpenGL Version (now called Version 3) were Allen
Ingling's work, supported by core grant NEI P30 EY013079. Mario Kleiner
then made extensive improvements to bring Version 3 to its current
state. Richard Murray contributed the direct interface to OpenGL
calls (MOGL). Tobias Wolf contributed the automatic documentation
generator that generates our online function reference.

Version 3 is under [active development.](developers)

If you want to acknowledge use of this software when you publish your
research, you might say something like this,

"We wrote our experiments in Matlab, using the Psychophysics Toolbox
extensions (Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997; Kleiner et al, 2007)."

We're happy and grateful to find that more and more users are now citing
their use of this software. Getting this credit helps us justify the
time we continue to devote to developing and maintaining this free
software for use by the entire vision community.

Although these papers were written in reference to Version 2 of the
toolbox, they remain the best current citation. Once the software
stabilizes a bit more, we hope to write a short note describing the
design and implementation of Version 3 so that appropriate credit may be
given to those who made substantial contributions to PTB-3.
